[] Has a premade default Component and function set

[] Can save / load project

[] Entity editor
[] Hammer editor
[] Component editor

[] Has a runtime - loader - whatever, this is a seperate function



components and entitites have their code saved/stored as string
_logic = function(this.script) <- this will run that script
OR
when script is needed to be executed use function(script)
OR (this actually works)

this.draw = new Function("console.log(this.x)") <- has acces to >this<

or other version

this.draw = new Function(this.script) <- this.script = "c.log(this.x)"

well actually when we want to run code from an entity we add:
or
when we init Entities (when game starts, asset loading) we add:

Entity._logic = new Function(Entity.script) <- kinda sad but gets
the job done :)


ide previewer has different methods of rendering
well not really
ide uses entitiy's component logic function
