//Premade Books, functions, etc...
let Global = {} //stores user specified shit
let Input = {}
let Delta = number //time ellapsed 


//Where the assets and code are stored
//And this is the object that is edited via the IDE
let Game = {
	Res: {}
	Settings: {}

	OR instead have seperate "folders" for each resource

	Sprites: {}
	Entities: {}
	Levels: {}
	Components: {}
	Settings: {}
	Inputs: {}
}


//Game Runner & Loader // user cant modify this via IDE
//maybe all of this is wrapped in a function? idk

declared logical arrays here eg: _entityArray()

settings loading

asset preloading

step down bellow maybe will be just added to the asset preloader
add functions to entities and components based on their script
Entity._logic = new Function(Entity.script)
Component._logic = new Function(Component.script)

level loader loads the first level

gameloop function here
{
	inside here are the methods to make things work
	_entityArra.forEach(entity=> )
}
